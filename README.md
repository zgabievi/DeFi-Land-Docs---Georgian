DeFi Land is a unique, multi-chain agriculture-simulation game created to gamify all aspects of decentralized finance. The main goal of the game is to make it easier and simpler for individuals to take part in the exciting world of DeFi and crypto, while also having the opportunity to have fun.

DeFi Land offers all the features that traditional platforms have, but everything is gathered in one place. The game offers players the opportunity to start playing for free, grind their way up to the Play and Earn tier (or simply purchase a Gen-0 NFT), compete with other players, craft, trade, and dive into DeFi in a fun and exciting way.

The native utility token is called DFL, and it can be used for:

* Trading in-game assets and NFTs
* Staking and LP incentives
* Game mechanics
* Governance votes, giving players the opportunity to determine how the network resources are allocated

The Play and Earn model introduced by DeFi Land allows users to earn income for completing tasks or reaching certain milestones. The game has something for everyone - whether you are looking for something laid-back and fun or something active and exciting, you can find it on DeFi Land.

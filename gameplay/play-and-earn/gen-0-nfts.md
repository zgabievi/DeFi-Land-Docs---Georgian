# Gen-0 NFTs

DeFi Land NFTs are your keys to unlock Play and Earn in DeFi Land. On February 9, 2022, our community minted 7500 NFT seeds in our first ever gamified NFT drop. Our players watered those seeds for 30 days before they blossomed into the coveted collection of Gen-0 NFTs. There are now approximately 21000 Gen-0 NFTs in circulation ranging from affordable entry-level items to extremely scarce legendary items and 1/1s. The Gen-0 NFTs include the fishing rod, the hunting gun, the harvester, and the animals. Each NFT type unlocks Play and Earn for its specific gameplay and consists of 4 attributes that provide a distinct advantage depending on their rarity and level (covered in [Rarity and Attributes](rarity-and-attributes.md)). Here is a brief explanation of each NFT type:

### **How Does DeFi Land Gamify Decentralized Finance?**

Adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies is on the rise, but many people are still intimidated to dip their toes into the complex world of Decentralized Finance. Decentralized Finance, or DeFi for short, empowers users to easily swap between tokens, support their favorite projects on the blockchain, and earn yield through liquidity pools. We understand the need for an accessible platform that translates complex DeFi practices into a friendly user experience. DeFi Land is an agricultural simulation of DeFi that offers token swapping, portfolio tracking, and yield farming. Instead of navigating through intimidating DeFi trading websites, you can perform all of these tasks in your very own farming village. Swap tokens in our marketplace, plant seeds to simulate your yield farming positions, and monitor your portfolio while fishing, hunting, harvesting, and tending to your pets. DeFi Land has something for everyone, whether you an investor, a gamer, or simply curious about the peaceful revolution of decentralized finance.

### **What Powers DeFi Land?**

The DeFi features in your village are powered by existing protocols, meaning we only serve up the front-end experience. While developing DeFi Land, we decided not to create our own swap, pools, or farming mechanics. Our focus is strictly on the user experience, gamification, and educational aspects of the onboarding process. In this way, we are building a much-needed service to the ecosystem while empowering existing protocols. Simply put, we are not competing with other platforms on the Solana chain. As we bring more traffic to our game, we will drive traffic to the protocols we have incorporated into our trading platform. We have active collaborations and integrations with Serum, Raydium, Orca, Tulip, and Saber.

### Growing with DeFi

As DeFi continues to grow and attract more people around the world, we believe that DeFi Land can play a major role in the future development of the industry. Our project is full of opportunities for beginners, making it a perfect place to start learning and growing. We will continue to add new features, including lending, borrowing, staking, liquidity provision, and more. We are most excited about our multi-chain expansion. In the summer of 2022, we will begin our alpha testing for multi-chain integration with the most promising L1s and L2s to bring even more DeFi services to the game. We will introduce new islands for each blockchain with bridges that allow you to travel (and trade!) in between each. DeFi Land will be the multi-chain hub for innovative protocols.

# DeFi Land - A Community-Led Project

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

DeFi Land is truly a community-led project. The main aim of our project is to support the whole crypto and DeFi community and help the market grow and develop further over the next few years. We have created a platform that is perfect for newcomers, offering them the opportunity to get started in a very short time, learn more about the market, and do all these things without having to pay any money.

We are very focused on the community. A great example of this is that we decided to base DeFi Land on pre-existing protocols, which ensures that if DeFi Land grows and becomes successful, so will the whole ecosystem.

The game is guided by its community as it comes with community-driven governance. This is a very important factor for our future development. It means that every single player has a say in how the game continues to be developed and the direction that is chosen in the future.

We ensure that the voices of our players are heard at all times. This is why we have created the Bug Report feature, which is a great way for users to provide feedback to us.
